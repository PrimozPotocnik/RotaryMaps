      <h1>Census of Rotary Maps by Genus and Number of Edges</h1>

        During a workshop on Symmetries of discrete structures in Kranjska Gora in 2022, Marston Conder suggested that it would be worth extending his <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/">census</a> of rotary maps of small genus (that went up to genus 301). To do that, an extension of the census of rotary maps on up to 1500/3000 edges in the non-orientable/orientable case (constructed by <strong>Pablo Spiga</strong>, <strong>Gabriel Verret</strong> and <strong>Primož Potočnik</strong> in 2014) would be useful. Using the same mathematical ideas, but improving and optimising some of the algorithms, we obtained a complete list of rotary maps (both chiral as well as fully regular) on <strong> up to 6000 edges in the orientable case</strong>, and <strong>up to 3000 edges in the non-orientable case</strong>. With some extra work (dealing with the maps of some particular valencies and face-lengths), we obtained all rotary maps on surfaces of <strong>genus up to 1501 in the orientable case</strong> and up to <strong>1502 in the non-orientable case</strong>.

        <h3>Census by genus</h3>
        Some basic information about the rotary maps of these genera are stored in the <strong>excel files</strong> below (see <a href="files/byGenus/ColumnDescription.html">here</a> for the explanation of the column labels):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/byGenus/Genus1501maps-chiral-data.xlsx">chiral maps</a> of genus between 2 and 1501 (8.8MB)</li>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/byGenus/Genus1501maps-orientable-refl-data.xlsx">regular orientable maps</a> of genus between 2 and 1501 (34.7MB)</li>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/byGenus/Genus1502maps-nonorientable-data.xlsx">regular non-orientable maps</a> of genus between 3 and 1502 (2.2MB)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The actual maps are given as a <strong>magma package</strong>, which is available for <a href="files/byGenus/RotaryMapsByGenus.zip">download</a> as a <strong>zipped file</strong> (12 MB). 
        The functionalities of the magma package are described in a <a href="files/byGenus/MagmaPackageDescription.html">text file</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Census by the number of edges</h3> 
        The information of all rotary maps with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges will soon become available here.<br>
        Some basic information about the rotary maps with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges (at most 6000 edges in the orientable case) are stored in the <strong>excel files</strong> below (see <a href="files/byEdges/ColumnDescription.html">here</a> for the explanation of the column labels):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/byEdges/RegularMaps3kEData.xlsx">fully regular maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges (30.9 MB)</li>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/byEdges/ChiralMaps6kEData.xlsx">chiral maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 6000 edges (46.1 MB)</li>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/byEdges/LargeORMdata.xlsx">large regular orientable maps</a> with at least 3001 and at most 6000 edges (22.4 MB)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The actual maps are given as <strong>magma packages</strong>, which are available for download as <strong>zipped files</strong> at the following links:
      </p> 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="files/byEdges/RegularMaps.zip">Fully regular maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges (11.2 MB)</li>
          <li><a href="files/byEdges/ChiralMaps.zip">Chiral maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 6000 edges (18.9 MB)</li> 
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/LargeRegularOrientedMaps.zip">Large regular orientable maps</a> with at least 3001 and at most 6000 edges. This zipped file contains also a magma package with all 2*-groups of order at most 12000 (3.88 GB)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The functionalities of the magma package are described in <a href="files/byEdges/MagmaPackageDescription.html">this file</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Census of the skeletons</h3>
        We have also computed the skeletons (underlying graphs) of all rotary maps having at most 3000 edges. We provide two separate <strong>excel files</strong> for the skeletons of all rotary maps, and for the skeletons of polyhedral rotary maps (see <a href="files/skeletons/ColumnDescription.html">here</a> for the explanation of the column labels):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/skeletons/SkeletonsData-3000.xlsx">skeletons of all rotary maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges.</li>
          <li>Excel spreadsheet of <a href="files/skeletons/PolyhedralSkeletonsData-3000.xlsx">skeletons of all polyhedral rotary maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The skeleton graphs can be explicitly contructed within the magma package available for <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Skeletons.zip">download</a> in a zipped file (141 MB). The functionalities of the magma package are described in the <a href="files/byEdges/MagmaPackageDescription.html">description file</a> for the census by the number of edges.
