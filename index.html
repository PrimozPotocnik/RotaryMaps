      <h2>Census of rotary maps by genus and by the number of edges - extended (joint work with Marston Conder)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        During a workshop on Symmetries of discrete structures in Kranjska Gora in 2022, Marston Conder suggested that it would be worth extending his <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/">census</a> of rotary maps of small genus (that went up to genus 301). To do that, an extension of the census of rotary maps on up to 1500/3000 edges in the non-orientable/orientable case (constructed by Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself in 2014) would be useful. Using the same mathematical ideas, but improving and optimising some of the algorithms, we obtained a complete list of rotary maps (both chiral as well as reflexible) on <strong> up to 6000 edges in the orientable case</strong>, and <strong>up to 3000 edges in the non-orientable case</strong>. With some extra work (dealing with the maps of some particular valencies and face-lengths), we obtained all rotary maps on surfaces of <strong>genus up to 1501 in the orientable case</strong> and up to <strong>1502 in the non-orientable case</strong>.

      <p>
        <strong>Census by genus.</strong> 
        Some basic information about the rotary maps of these genera are stored in the excel files below (see <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/ColumnDescription.txt">here</a> for the explanation of the column labels):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Genus1501maps-chiral-data.xlsx">Chiral maps</a> of genus between 2 and 1501.</li>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Genus1501maps-orientable-refl-data.xlsx">Regular orientable maps</a> of genus between 2 and 1501.</li>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Genus1502maps-nonorientable-data.xlsx">Regular non-orientable maps</a> of genus between 3 and 1502.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        The actual maps are given as a magma package, which is available for download as a  
        <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/RotaryMapsByGenus.zip">zipped file</a> (12MB). 
        The functionalities of the magma package are described in a <a href="files/Readme.txt">text file</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Census by the number of edges.</strong> 
        The information of all rotary maps with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges will soon become available here.<br>
        Some basic information about the rotary maps with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges (at most 6000 edges in the orientable case) are stored in the <strong>excel files</strong> below (see <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/ColumnDescription-ByEdges.txt">here</a> for the explanation of the column labels):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/RegularMaps3kEData.xlsx">Fully regular maps</a> on up to 3000 edges (orientable and non-orientable).</li>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/ChiralMaps6kEData.xlsx">Chiral maps</a> on up to 6000 edges.</li>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/LargeORMdata.xlsx">Large regular orientable maps</a> on at least 3001 and at most 6000 edges.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        We have also computed the skeletons (underlying graphs) of all rotary maps having at most 3000 edges. We provide two separate <strong>excel files</strong> for the skeletons of all rotary maps, and for the skeletons of polyhedral rotary maps (see <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/ColumnDescription-Skeletons.txt">here</a> for the explanation of the column labels):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/SkeletonsData-3000.xlsx">Skeletons of all rotary maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges.</li>
          <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/PolyhedralSkeletonsData-3000.xlsx">Skeletons of all polyhedral rotary maps</a> with at least 2 and at most 3000 edges.</li>
